      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>This project aimed to identify Texas counties most vulnerable to hurricanes based on their geographical location and population size.</p>

      <h2>Data Cleaning and Exploration</h2>
      <p>Our team began by importing and cleaning GIS data on Texas counties, removing duplicates and missing values. We then analyzed the latitude and longitude coordinates to assess each county's geographical positioning.</p>

      <h2>Hurricane-Prone Zones</h2>
      <p>We found that hurricane-prone zones lie between latitudes 5-30. We visualized this through scatter plots, highlighting counties in this range. Notably, these counties are primarily in southern Texas.</p>

      <h2>Joint Plots and Clustering</h2>
      <p>To delve deeper into the spatial distribution of Texas counties, we created joint plots to visualize relationships between latitude and longitude coordinates. These plots offer insights into how counties are geographically clustered.</p>

      <h4>Northeast Clustering</h4>
      <p>The visualizations show that counties are densely clustered in the northeastern regions, which are generally outside of the hurricane-prone zones.</p>

      <h4>Coastal Distribution</h4>
      <p>In contrast, counties along coastal regions exhibit a more dispersed distribution, aligning with the hurricane-prone zone findings.</p>

      <h4>Density Representations</h4>
      <p>The joint plots use color gradations to indicate clustering density. Darker regions show areas where data points are more densely packed, while lighter regions reflect sparser distributions.</p>

      <h2>Population Impact:</h2>
      <img src="https://github.com/daniellebalque/images/raw/main/Unknown-8.png" alt="Texas Counties by Population" class="center">
      <p>We also analyzed population data to assess which counties had the highest populations and intersected with hurricane-prone zones. The top ten counties by population were visualized, with four of these counties also being in the hurricane-prone zone: Bexar, Fort Bend, Harris, and Hidalgo. The final plot emphasized these high-risk counties with enlarged markers.</p>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>The analysis demonstrated that Texas has a considerable number of counties at risk from hurricanes, particularly in the southern regions. Furthermore, several of these counties also have large populations, indicating a significant potential impact from hurricane events.</p>
